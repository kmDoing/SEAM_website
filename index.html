 		<p>I am currently working to reestablish a career in cognitive modeling. Although, I would
 		like to first gain the experience necessary to fully understand computational modeling as it
 		is used in cognitive science, if asked to describe how I would build on my previous work, I 
 		would say that I want to take
 		a page from computer vision systems and apply it to text processing. I plan to create a 
 		hierarchical system, which begins with attentional mechanisms and ends with a representation 
 		of the ontologic entities referred to in the text.</p>
 		<p>For the past 2 
 		years I lectured in psychology (Introductory, Cognition), computer science (Introductory-)
 		Java, Machine Learning), and Research Design and Statistics at Westminster College in
 		Salt Lake City.</p>
 		<p>My most recent research has been as a consultant in qualitative methods and ontology 
 		development with Dr. Charlene Weir in the Univesity of Utah Biomedical Informatics department.
 		We are creating an ontology of patient frailty indications. The goal of the project is to 
 		automatically rank patient records for frailty with respect to cardiac interventions.</p>
 		<p>Until October 2015, I was working as a Research Scientist with Dr. John Hurdle on the 
     	POET2 research project in Biomedical Informatics.</p>
     	<p><b>NLP Research Interests</b></p>
     	<p>It apparent to me that natural language processing systems are experiencing a 
     	significant improvement in performance through the combination of Machine Learning 
     	techniques with the architecture of the human cognitive system as evidenced by the success of
     	deep learning techniques. We created a system that did not use deep learning, but was motivated
     	by the current understanding of human text processing. POET is a multi-level, multi-path system built in UIMA modules 
     	(e.g., dependency parsing, rule-based, ML) that reflect findings from Cognitive Science 
     	(e.g., dorsal-ventral language processing streams, differential processes indicated by 
     	the N400 ERP wave).</p>
     	</p><p>
     	<p><b>Health Care Research Interests</b></p>
    	It is my belief that health care (diagnostic accuracy and efficiency) can be improved by 
    	accessing the wealth of information available in the free-text of electronic health 
    	records. The key is to recover and analyze the information for timely and appropriate 
    	presentation to facilitate cliniciansâ€™ cognitive processing.

    	research.
